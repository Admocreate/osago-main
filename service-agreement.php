                                shall be made through In-App Payment. Where a User fails
                                or refuses to pay, the Company in its limited payment
                                collection agent capacity shall, solely for the purpose
                                of accepting the Fare, send a notice of debt to the User
                                on behalf of the Customer, and the Company shall not be
                                obligated to compensate the Customer for Fare not paid
                                by the User. If the User justifiably refuses to pay the
                                Fare on the grounds that the information provided by the
                                Customer or the Driver on the Company App is incorrect,
                                Company shall not reimburse the Customer for such
                                expenses.</li>

                                procure that its Drivers shall, not refuse or
                                influence the User against the use of the In-App
                                Payment. In the event the Customer or any of its
                                Drivers refuse to accept an In-App Payment, the
                                Company shall be entitled to charge the Customer a
                                contractual penalty calculated as 10% of the Fare
                                for every refusal and/or block the right to access
                                and use the App and OsaGo Services in the case of
                                repetitive behaviour.</li>

                                is being provided to the right User or the User
                                has expressly confirmed the use of his account
                                for provision of Transportation Service to a
                                third party.</li>
                            <li>In the event that the Company is unable to
                                remit Fares to the Customer due to
                                incorrect, or unavailability of bank account

                                shall be deemed to have waived its right to
                                such claim regarding the payment of the Fare
                                and such claim shall be deemed to have

                                the User applies the Promo Code. Where

                                terms and conditions in respect of the
                                use of the Promo Code, then the Promo
