                    <h4>Family time</h4>

                    <p>
                        Maybe it’s the sharp contrast with the bustling city life, but Lagos seaside restaurants afford the serenity and calm needed for bonding. A good meal with your spouse and children over the waves, currents and the cool breeze, create lifelong memories, and offer needed the much-needed relaxation after a long Lagos week.

                    <h4>Exotic cuisine</h4>

                    <p>
                        Let’s face it: sometimes we get bored with home-cooked meals, and would need to taste something different. Beyond that, eating an exotic meal out creates a memorable experience with loved ones. A little lobster, sushi or Chinese food by a Lagos seaside restaurant won’t be bad.

                    <p>
                        And, if there’s no exotic restaurant along the shore that you know of, why not create the experience at any of the Lagos private beaches? Get a cookbook and practice ahead of time though, if you aren’t exactly used to making exotic meals.

                    <h4>Ambience</h4>

                    <p>
                        Food and nature go hand-in-hand. There’s nothing better than enjoying your favourite with fine, crisp, coastal breeze on your face. Better still, you get the much-needed tranquility in Lagos. Eating out at a Lagos seaside restaurant on a weekend is one way to rest your frail nerves from all that hustle and bustle in the past week.
