                        Lagos and its zillion vehicles in gridlock can be too much to take in on a weekday. On any day, in fact. However, little is known about the state’s aquatic splendour, which offers a relaxing experience that can be relived in the daily commute.

                        As water transportation gains increasing acceptance among Lagosians, going by boat is now the perfect way to enjoy the soothing calmness of the Lagos lagoon. And we are not just talking about any boat, but the banana boat such as the one used by Osago, that allows you to enjoy the Lagos lagoon while on your way to that business meeting. You’ll agree that’s one way to be relieved of the Lagos stress in between important errands. Moreover, you’ll also slash your commute time considerably when you commute by boat.

                        Furthermore, if boats offer the thrilling experience in between work, banana boats offer even more adventure, as the no-roof design offers you the front-row seat to nature, and that’s beside the reduced feeling of being overcrowded when compared to the other boat types.

                        Of a truth, a little fun and adventure on a weekday is good for the mood; and while the use of open banana boats have proven to as safe as other types, much of the issue of safety is addressed with the proper training of boat riders; and at Osago, we are especially fastidious about safety, and have ensured we that only trained riders operate our banana boats.

                        Did you know that you could spend up to 80% less time commuting the islands to the mainland on any of Osago’s open banana boats?  Have you downloaded the Osago app for access to Nigeria’s first boat chartering service?
