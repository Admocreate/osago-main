                        If you are Nigerian, you’re probably wincing at this topic. And the more southwestern you are, the likelier you are to disagree with us, but, stay with us for 2 minutes.

                    <p>
                        It’s true; boats, just like the aeroplane, are a lot safer than cars, as means of transportation. According to a BBC article that analyzed the safety of road transportation in comparison to water and air transportation, commuting by boat is nearly as safe as flying, with both options far safer than driving.

                    <p>
                        Although the BBC article cited the scarcity of data for the safety of water transportation following the sinking of the Costa Concordia, a cruise ship in 2012, it assessed and compared fatalities from each mode of transportation, and arrived at a compelling conclusion that you are likelier to die in a car accident than you are on a ship.

                    <p>
                        It’s not yet Uhuru for water transportation though, as several factors must be considered given that cruise ships are quite different from ferries, yachts or speed boats as used by Osago, for instance. Therefore, factors such as speed and passenger size are tenable and, then, the study above was outside the shores of Nigeria. So, let’s be specific, shall we?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, 39,802 Nigerians die from road accidents annually, compared to another report that pegs the figure of fatalities from boat mishaps at 1609 between 2006 and 2015. That’s an average of 201 deaths annually. With these compelling statistics, you’ll agree with us that, for Nigeria, going by boat is safer than travelling by road.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In fairness to the statistics, there are other factors to consider in the Nigerian context. One of such is the differing volumes of traffic for road and water transportation, with the former enjoying more commuters. However, with intensified efforts from regulators of the transportation sector towards making the Nigerian waterways safer, more Lagosians, for example, have shown increased confidence in water transportation, as a way of beating the usual gridlock on the roads.
